# Wordmind

Hi! this is a vocabulary builder application, it's called `Wordmind`. 

It's powered by `text to speech` and a `dictionary API`. After searching for the specific word,
the meaning and the sample sentence of the word could be saved to a database which is called `Hive`.

There is a `Language dropdown button`, user also can choose the language of the voice.
