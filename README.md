# Wordmind

Hi! this is a vocabulary builder application, it's called `Wordmind`. 

It's powered by text to speech and a dictionary API. After searching for the specific word,
it could be saved to a database which is called `Hive`.

Words could be looped by using time picker. After the choosen time each word could be voiced
by `text to speech` by the choosen time one by one.

There is a `Language dropdown button`, user also can choose the language of the voice.
